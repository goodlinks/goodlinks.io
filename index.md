Hey there, I'm Kalen.  I built and run a SaaS app that does email
marketing automation for online stores, called MageMail.

I'm glad that you stopped by and I'm really excited to let you
know about this new project.

GoodLinks is an eCommerce content marketing outreach service, with
a mission of creating high paying jobs for inner city youth.

While eCommerce is a massive growth industry, the economy at large is struggling,
and in many places inner city youth unemployment is at 40%, 50%, or 60%.

This is a massively untapped pool of talent, that while they don't have access
many times to great education and resources, they have the raw intelligence,
creativity, motivation, and drive to become excellent content outreach specialists.

We're going to work with industry leading content marketers to
develop a training fellowship to accelerate their education.

Equipped with excellent training, mentorship, accountability, and best in
class tools for CRM, media contact databases, search engine tracking tools, in a matter of weeks
they'll be up to speed working on live customer projects,
while continuing to level up their skills through ongoing training modules.

Andela is a business that has an excellent model for this - with a campus and training
fellowship in Lagos, Nigeria, they are recruiting and developing world
class software engineering talent, while creating high-paying jobs
for local Nigerians.

We plan to do the same in the content outreach space.

Content marketing is one of the most effective ways for online stores
to grow their businesses.

What we've learned over the past decade is that there are only two
fundamental and unchanging truths about content marketing

1. you have to have good content that's actually interesting and unique.

2. your outreach has to be personalized, not automated, relevant, and intelligent
 with content that's actually useful to the person you're contacting,
 in order to build natural links.

There are a number of problems with many providers in the space:

 - not specialized - they offer a range of services from digital strategy to pay per click to creative to outreach
 - very expensive with long term contract lock-in
 - many times their activities are opaque, not giving you visibility into their outreach and link building
 activities.  This is particularly problematic as many businesses have been penalized by Google in the past
 for low quality link building techniques.

We plan to solve these by:

 - specializing in outreach
 - billing on a monthly basis with no contract lock-in
 - having a price point that will be both highly profitable and at the same time more affordable than other options
 - making all outreach and earned links fully transparent through a customer dashboard that can be accessed at any time

I've had great success with MageMail - growing 5% to 15% month over month for the past 18 months,
and essentially solved similar problems in the email automation space

- more specialized for magento triggered email with a feature set that rivals the most expensive enterprise options
- no long term contracts
- it has a lower price point than virtually all of our competitors
