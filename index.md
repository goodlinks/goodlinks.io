Hey there!

I'm Kalen.  I built and run a SaaS app that does email
marketing automation for online stores, called <a href="https://magemail.co" target="_blank">MageMail</a>.

I'm glad that you stopped by and I'm really excited to let you
know about this new project!

**GoodLinks is an eCommerce content marketing outreach service, with
a mission of creating high-paying jobs for inner city youth.**

---

While eCommerce is a massive growth industry, the economy at large is struggling,
and, in many places inner city youth unemployment is up to 50% or 60%.

This is a massively untapped pool of talent, that many times doesn't have access
to great educational resources, but nevertheless has the raw intelligence,
creativity, motivation, and drive to become excellent content outreach specialists.

We're going to work with industry-leading content marketers to
develop a training fellowship to accelerate their education.

Equipped with excellent training, mentorship, accountability, and best-in-class tools,
in a matter of weeks they'll be up to speed working on live customer projects,
while continuing to level up their skills through ongoing training modules.

<a href="http://andela.com" target="_blank">Andela</a> is a business that has an excellent model for this - with a campus and training
fellowship in Lagos, Nigeria, they are recruiting and developing world
class software engineering talent, while creating high-paying jobs
for local Nigerians.

We plan to do the same in the content outreach space.

Content marketing is one of the most effective ways for online stores
to grow their business.

What we've learned over the past decade is that **there are only two
fundamental and unchanging truths** about content marketing

1. You've got to have good content that's actually interesting and unique.

2. Your outreach has to be personalized (not automated), relevant, and intelligent,
 with something actually useful to offer, in order to build natural links.

There are a number of issues with current providers in this space:

 - **Not specialized** - they offer a range of services from digital strategy to pay per click to creative to outreach
 - Very expensive, with **long-term contract lock-in**
 - Many times their activities are **opaque**, not giving you visibility into their outreach and link building
 activities (this is particularly problematic as many businesses have been penalized by Google in the past
for low quality link building techniques)

We plan to solve for these by:

 - **Specializing** in content outreach
 - Billing on a **monthly basis with no contract lock-in**
 - Selling at a price point that will be both highly profitable for us, and at the same time **more affordable** than many other providers
 - Making all outreach and earned links **fully transparent** through a customer dashboard that can be accessed at any time

I've had great success with MageMail - growing 5% to 15% month-over-month for the past 18 months,
and essentially solved similar problems in the email automation space

- MageMail is more specialized for Magento, with a feature set that rivals the most expensive enterprise options
- There are no long term contracts
- It has a lower price point than virtually all of the competition.

We're going to be documenting the journey of creating this business, so that you
can follow along with us, learn from us, and help us.  There's a podcast that you can

Right now we're working on branding.  I'm excited to be working with <a href="http://antonela.me/">Antonela Debiasi</a>,
the designer and UX that built the MageMail brand.

I'm also really excited about the team of advisors that I have:

 - <a href="https://about.me/dhru" target="_blank">Dhru Purohit</a> is an Entrepreneur + Investor, the co-Founder of the Clean Program, and a
contributing author to two New York times best sellers.  He has deep expertise
at the intersection of eCommerce, content, and wellness.

for small to mid-sized eCommerce businesses.

We're going to be accepting a handful of beta customers at a reduced price structure,
on the basis of already have strong content but needing help with the outreach.
